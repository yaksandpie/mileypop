A "steam" powered, gambling-style ferry on the [[River Styx]]. [[Captian Cervantez]] is the boss. It travels through the various planes, bringing souls to their destination.

In order to move between the planes, it needs to have a "shard" of the primal energy source. For example, a Chaos crystal for the plane of Limbo. These very seldomly break.

Has rowboats for going off ship and finding these shards. The rowboats are equipped with:
- Compass with runes and an empty vial attached. Putting a piece something in the vial will make the compass point towards the original thing.
- A single vial of red potion.
- One coin: "Currency of the realm of Batar; One mortal soul."
- A map that fills in as you use it.
