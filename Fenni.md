A druid from small village, deep in the [[Feywilds]]. His earliest memories are about his escaping his village burning. [[Blink Dogs]] who were friends with the village, managed to quickly escape, taking Fenni with them. At a safe distance from the shrieks and screams of the mass evacuation, they managed to teleport the young Firbolg to normal world.

A wool-shepherding couple found him and raised him for a few years before they died of natural causes. He took over the shepherding and lived peacefully next to a village. 

The village immediately took Fenni in as one of their own. He wasn't the most social amongst the folk and often was standoff-ish but he particular did well with getting the children of town to smile. They loved watching him use druidcraft magic and turning into a sheep. 

Fenni loved his life with the sheep and the sheep loved him. He was easy able to sway his flock with his natural Firbolg animal speaking voice. One sheep in particular was his favorite. They were nearly inseparable and that sheep mysteriously lived the entirety of Fenni's life. After establishing a good rapport with this sheep, Fenni was able to feel what it was to be a sheep and how to be a sheep. At that moment, Fenni realized his connection to nature.

Fenni also understood that this village was quite poor and always struggled to pay the tax collectors. He took it on himself, decade after decade, to disguise the few roads that go to the village so that the tax collectors and their guard would inadvertently skip over this village. One year, about fifty years of trying to help the village, the tax collectors came with an extended guard. They had figured out something was amiss and they were going to make a lesson of this village. They managed to find the village. They gathered everyone in square demanding to know what happened. The village had no knowledge of what Fenni was doing. Fenni stepped forward and admitted his plan to protect the village. The guards began to light fires throughout the town as the man in charge yelled at Fenni that this whole village was going to get razed. Fenni remembers a sharp pain and then nothing.

Flickers of life. He remembers other flickers join him. At the time nameless but now known as [[Aslan]], [[Brisingr]], [[Hardisty]], and [[Zinfir]].

[[Moya]] rescued them and negotiated for their employment on the [[Final Rights]]. He works under [[Kiyeron]] in command, along with [[Zinfir]].

When the [[Final Rights]] ran out of plane shard energy, Fenni and his group were tasked with finding some chaos energy in [[Limbo]]. There, they became friends with a group of [[Gith]].
