A "city" of sorts in [[Limbo]]. Non-Euchlidian geometry. The people around are nonsensical and very confusing. 

[[Hardisty]], [[Zinfir]], [[Brisingr]], and [[Fenni]] came here to retrieve [[Poetry]] for her patron.

While there, a massive creature with long arms helped locate [[Poetry]] when [[Fenni]] heard them speaking Giant and asked. The massive creature wanted [[Fenni]] to show the "jerks" a lesson. [[Fenni]] failed as the denizens there were too strong.
